## Some thoughts:

I really enjoyed this homework assignment. It has been a great learning opportunity and a chance to test my current
skills and knowledge. Some stuff really tripped me up, mainly the infinite scroll part. I have spent quite a few 
hours troubleshooting and trying to understand what was wrong, why is it broken. In the end, I feel very proud of
myself for figuring it all out. If I had more time available, I would definitely add a search bar to allow users to
search for their preferred pictures, not just cats. If I was able to use React routers, I'd create a separate route
and display the favourited pictures, with the ability to get higher quality images once clicked on.


Cheers,
